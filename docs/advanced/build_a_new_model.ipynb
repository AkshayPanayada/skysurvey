    "## Build a transient model\n",
    "\n",
    "The modelling is based on [modeldag](https://github.com/MickaelRigault/modeldag)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "To generate ``data``, the code reads **model** line-by-line and follows the instructions it contains. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this SNeIa example, **model** contains 8 entries. So the generated ``data`` will contains at least 8 columns (see the *as* option).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *model*, *param*, *as*, *input*\n",
    "\n",
    "A **model** entry accepts 4 keywords:\n",
    "  1. *func*: (name of) the function used to draw the sample, e.g. np.random.uniform ;\n",
    "  2. *kwargs*: options that enter the function as kwargs , '@key' could be used to get input as former entry result;\n",
    "  3. *as*: (list of) name(s) of the column on the resulting ``data`` ;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"@\" in \"kwargs\" to form a \"DAG\"\n",
    "The *@* trick in kwargs  enables you to generate self-consistent parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the absolute magnitude of a SNeIa depends on its stretch and color (following the ``alpha*x_1 - beta*c `` Tripp's relation). Hence, once the ``x_1``and ``c`` (independent) variables have been drawn, the SNeIa absolute magnitude (``magabs``) can be obtained using as input the already drawn ``x_1`` and ``c`` parameters. Same goes for the observed magnitude, it only dependents on the absolute magnitude ``magabs`` and the redshift ``z``. \n",
    "\n",
    "The (potentially complex) connections between the variables enabled by using *@key* (e.g. ``@c``) corresponds to the creation a [Directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).\n",
    "You can complexify as you which your **model** creating as many variables and intermediate variables as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### the *func* option, where to define the function\n",
    "\n",
    "The *func* option is the function that will be used to generate the dataset. In principle, it should accept ``size`` as parameters and return N=size values except if a \"@\" is used in input (for its size is alreadyu defined by the initial called key)\n",
    "\n",
    "In your **model**, the *func* option can be a function or a string. \n",
    " - a function will be used as such\n",
    " - a string will be converted in function, it typically means you input a method of the class ; though more advanced tools exist, see \"Build a new Model\" documentation."
